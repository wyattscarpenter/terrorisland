Please enjoy this local mirror and book-version of the webcomic _Terror Island_ of terrorisland.net

This project contains (or will contain), two folders: mirror/, which is a local mirror of terrorisland.net, and book/, which houses versions of a book made from that mirror.

This project is NOT free software / libre!!! The webcomic belongs to its authors. Any software or content additionally made for this project is (by the very declaration of this sentence) effectively public domain in all respects EXCEPT that if you modify the book-versions you have to change the name of the edition, and describe your changes; so, for example, if your name is johnsmith, and the year is 2024, and you make one of the book-versions blue-tinted for some reason, please change the relevant name of the book-version to, eg, unofficial-johnsmith-2024, and perhaps make your own foreward or addendum to my foreward describing your changes (you can also just describe your changes in a readme, or, in extremis, merely the git history of the project). This constraint does not apply for changes you submit to my repo that I accept.

TODO: The mirror is slightly altered from what the mirror script will give you in order to include the bookmark button. instead, the mirror script should be altered to get that. Also, there are various things, like http://www.factitious.net/otherstuff/pirateday2007.jpg that should probably be mirrored by the mirror script, or taken from the last good copy on the internet archive. Possibly this can be rectified by some combination of -H -p -np in the script, and perhaps querying archive.org...

The number of pages in the pdf should be 369. Any more and it means you're leaking a page somewhere (or, perhaps, have included an extra page after I wrote this). But that's somewhat unavoidable, to get the text to read at a good size.

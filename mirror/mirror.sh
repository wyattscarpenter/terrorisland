wget -erobots=off --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --convert-links http://www.terrorisland.net
# Note that you canNOT just use terrorisland.net, you have to include the www. Or else maybe there's a setting in wget to deal with this, but I don't know it. Also, you have to ignore the robots.txt, because the webserve doesn't have one.

<!-- Ben Comments -->
Some of you may be wondering how the possessed stool moves around, given
that stools are normally inanimate objects. In fact, it can't move on
its own. The demon in it is effectively motionless, though capable of
speech.
</p>
<p>
Some of you may next be wondering, "But how do the other characters move
around? Aren't they also stools?" The answer is no. They are living
beings just like you and me.
</p>
<p>
This may raise a third question: "How do you and I move around?" Since
that isn't about Terror Island, I don't have to answer it.

<!-- Lewis Comments -->
Does anyone besides me remember the toy "Wizzard" or "Whizzard" or
something like that?  It was shaped like a light bulb, and had bit at
the bottom that could rotate, and you would get that bottom bit
spinning real fast, and then you'd have a spinning top. If that sounds
unexciting, or equally exciting as a regular spinning top, I have sorely
misdescribed this toy.
</p>
<p>
Normally I would google for it, or check e-bay or whatever, and see if
I'm making it up or if it really existed, but I couldn't come up with
any comments today, so I figured, why not let the <i>Terror Island</i>
be my google?
</p>
<p>
One last thing.  My last sentence in the above paragraph reminded me of
a ridiculous PSA campaign that was on TV when I was growing up. A dad
was getting into the car with his kid, but they didn't have a child
seat, and so they dad says, "That's OK, I'll be your safety belt." and
clasps his fingers around the kid's waist like a seat belt. Obviously,
the ad tells us that this is a bad plan, and that you should always
buckle up.  The point is, when I was growing up, I had no idea that some
of the commercials and stuff like that were specific to different towns,
and sometimes, when I am interacting with people, I forget that not
everyone saw those growing up, and then wind up having people think that
I am weird for randomly saying "I'll be your safety belt."
</p>
<p>
The most extreme example of this sort of thing is a ridiculous portion
of a standardized test I took all through grade school.  It was a memory
test, I think, and it would give you some gibberish words, paired with
real words.  You got some time to study those (like 10 minutes or
whatever), then you had to take a whole different test (like a math
test) and then they asked you questions about the gibberish words.
Every single time we took this test, the example sentence was the same.
"A baloo is a bear."  I took this test a number of tiems, and so that 
one is engrained pretty well in my head, but, don't worry, it's not the
only one I remember.  Luckily, part of my brain is irrevocably dedicated
to storing the following information:
<ol>
<li>
A baloo is a bear
</li>
<li>
A tay is a hammer
</li>
<li>
A pillot is a shoe
</li>
<li>
A yonker is a young man
</li>
<li>
A lep is a ball
</li>
<li>
A flix is a comb
</li>
<li>
A korf is a tiger
</li>
</ol>
These memory tests were used where I grew up, and a few other places
(Indiana, for one), but they weren't really all that widespread.  And it
is just the weirdest thing to realize that I constantly interact with
people who don't associate "korf" and "tiger."
</p>
<p>
Absolutely final note: according to the internet, there are two standard
entries on the test I am missing.  "To wuzzle means to mix" and "A
zillation is an alarm clock."  I don't remember either of those at all,
but I do remember a wonderful tv program <i>called</i> "<a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c82cAG6dOtE">The
Wuzzles</a>" featuring a cast of animal hybrids, like a bumblebee lion
and a kangaroo elephant, and a bunny-hippo.
</p>
<p>
And that, for those of you who are still reading, is a sampling of what
it is like inside my
head.

I like that the Green Grocer announces his name so often. Maybe if all
the characters did that sort of thing, people would find it easier to
remember who’s who.

Sometimes people ask me if philosophy of language has any practical
applications.  They are usually asking it rhetorically, or the way that
similar to asking rhetorically, but more as an insult than as an actual
rhetorical maneuver.  I have an answer for them, though, whether they
want it or not.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Let’s say you’re reading an article on Wikipedia, and for whatever
reason, some stupid dispute about neutrality resulted in the article
reading like this, “Some have claimed that 2 is the only even prime
number, but this is not accepted by all mathematicians.”  Well,
<i class="calibre10">pragmatics</i> is what philosophers of language and linguists call it
when there is more to what you conveyed than the literal meaning of your
words.  And it provides a formal basis to explain why phrasing the claim
that way, even if it is literally true, is highly misleading.  For
example, in this case, it is because making the weak statement that
some people have claimed 2 to be the only even prime suggests that the 
stronger statement that 2 is the only even prime number isn’t
warranted.  So the attempt to state things neutrally tends to indicate 
a pretty strong skepticism.  While this isn’t shocking, what is
shocking is the awesomely systematic way in which these implications
seem to get generated.  So remember, if someone asks why philosophy of
language is useful, the answer is that it gives us a way to explain why
the articles on Wikipedia sound so silly all the time.

Bonus points to anyone who can successfully get Wikipedia to adopt
language like this in the articles for primes and the number 2.

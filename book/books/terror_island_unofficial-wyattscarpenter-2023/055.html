Today is Angyl Bender’s birthday, so we made a strip answering her
question of “What if Sid or Stephen were to order some Chinese food or
something?” I’m not actually sure if Angyl asked that question, but I
think someone did, at some point. Human identities are pretty much
interchangeable anyway.

This strip is also notable for being the first use of the Pictionary
cube character. Those of you reading backwards through the archives
years after I wrote this will be chuckling to yourselves as to the
significance of this character, who, to those of us reading this at more
or less the time I’m posting it, is completely new.

One time, for like a month or so (maybe more), I went around telling
people that Ben had an imaginary girlfriend from Canada, and when Ben
insisted that he didn’t, I pointed out that I was in fact imagining
that a Canadian girl was dating Ben.  So, sometimes, when we’re deriving
a theorem for <i class="calibre10">Terror Island</i>, the gags in the theorem spookily
correspond to actual events in the real world.  The degree spooky of the
correspondence (the coefficient of ectoplasm, if you will), seems to
increase during October.  This is evidence that October’s role as
“spookiest month” may be less contingent than you thought.

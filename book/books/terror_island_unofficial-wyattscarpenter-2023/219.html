If you’ve been taken in by Gavriel’s argument that you shouldn’t bother
voting because one vote won’t make a difference, here’s something to
consider: You can increase the power of your vote by encouraging other
people to vote who wouldn’t have otherwise. If you’re part of a
community of people who share some or all of your political beliefs,
make sure they’re registered to vote. The more active you are, the
higher your vote multiplier becomes, and the better your chances of
getting a high score.

Fun fact: It was me, and not Ben, who suggested making a joke about the
incoherence of voting for the primehood of numbers.  From this, we can
conclude that Ben, the so-called mathematician, does not believe that it
would be foolish to hold elections for what properties are had by
various numbers.  Let’s all join together and remind Ben that 
mathematics is not a democracy.

This strip reminds me of the time in college when Lewis lost his shoes,
and I tricked him into thinking I had hidden them. It worked out well,
because I found them before he did, and then moved them somewhere else.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
I hope all of our readers have their shoes with them, and that each day
in our all-too-brief lives will shine ever brighter for having felt
thus.

If I had unlimited money and I had to spend it decadently, instead of
helping people with it, I think one thing I would do is buy brand new
socks every day.  None of those falling apart socks.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Also, I’d totally hire a personal assistant to keep track of things for
me, remind me of stuff I meant to do, etc.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
This is more fun than thinking about having magic powers, because it is
very slightly more likely that I have the means to buy new socks every
day than that I can actually perform magic.

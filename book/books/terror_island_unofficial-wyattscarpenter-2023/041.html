I’m pretty sure Lewis is going to explain the Spanish part, so I won’t.
Instead, I’ll point out that the reason Bizarro Aorist is blue is that
the Bizarro version of green kryptonite is blue kryptonite. The
radiation from blue kryptonite passes right through lead, but is blocked
by imperfect duplicates of lead.

<p class="calibre9">
The physics of Bizarro objects is pretty fascinating.

Ben and I were talking about how we should have gone after a niche
market.  Like how there are comics for <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com" class="calibre2">video game fans</a>, and comics for
<a href="http://www.overduemedia.com" class="calibre2">library fans</a>, and also one
for people who like <a href="http://www.plusev.net" class="calibre2">online poker
comics made by the guy who did Pupkin</a>.  Hell, there are even
comics for <a href="http://www.ctrlaltdel-online.com" class="calibre2">people who like
their jokes awkwardly overexplained</a>. The trouble is, our comic is
sort of niche already.  Just not a niche that you can put into words
easily.  Maybe I’ll have Ben make up a term.
</p>
<p class="calibre48"><i class="calibre52">Note: Ben says our niche is “people who
used to play board games and kind of want to see the pieces doing
things completely unrelated to those games.”</i>

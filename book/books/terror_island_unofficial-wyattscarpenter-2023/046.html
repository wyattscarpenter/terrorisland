This strip has more references than we usually include, so here are some
quick panel-by-panel annotations.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Panel 1: The hypno-kit was last mentioned in <a href="018.html" class="calibre2">strip #18</a>.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Panel 2: This panel speaks for itself, I think.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Panel 3: In NetHack, the “apply” command (default keystroke: a) is used
for credit cards and unicorn horns, among other things.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Panel 4: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager" class="calibre2">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal’s_Wager</a>

Ben is into molly-coddling, it would appear.  I figure you guys can fend
for yourselves with respect to the references, but he decided you needed
help.

This theorem initially gave us some difficulty to derive, largely
because we were going about it the wrong way.  See, we had the dialogue
initially laid out in a way that made some of the lines very difficult
to script so that they would express what needed to be expressed and be
sensible things for the respective characters to be saying.  It was very
satisfying to realize that it wasn’t because what we thought to be a
theorem was false, but instead because we were assuming the wrong
premises.  Once we fixed the dialogue (who was establishing what and in
what order that was being done) the strip fell into place with the sort
of naturalness that reminds us we are merely discovering these plots,
not creating them.

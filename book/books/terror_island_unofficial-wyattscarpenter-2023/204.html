It’s Gibbs and Lockley again! They haven’t been in the comic for a
while, and now you know why: Stephen fired them.

See that ceremonial sword behind Stephen in the flashback? It’s a kilt
pin I wore at my friend Albert’s wedding on Saturday. I had the honor of
being one of his groomsmen, which meant traditional Scottish attire
— pictures will be online eventually.

<!-- Lewis Comments -->
Stephen assumes unemployment problems are a matter of the distribution
of jobs among the employed, rather than an increase in the number of
employed people. This puts him at both ends of the standard political
continuum, and today’s strip was supposed to serve as political
commentary to that effect.

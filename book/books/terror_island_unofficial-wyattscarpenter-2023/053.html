Robert Asprin had a bit in one of his Myth books where two people argued
over ownership of a cat. The king thought he had an opportunity to act
wise, so he did the “Let it be cut in half” thing. The people went along
with this, and happily left to cut up the cat. Irritability did <a href="http://maze.icomix.com/comicpage/browse.php?index=224" class="calibre2">a slightly
different take on this</a>. Oddly, it also involved a cat. I guess
that’s one of the standard objects for this. Brecht and Solomon both
went with the child thing instead, though.

I like happy endings, so both of the petitioners get a lawnmower. Hooray
for Czar rule!

This strip came together pretty nicely.  I like when Ben and I come up
with a general idea (in this case Stephen holding court) and an idea for
the main gag (some play on that infanticide theory of justice from the
Old Testament) which lead us to a rough script, which we then chisel
away at until discovering the correct form.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
That was metaphorical chiseling, by the way.  Sculpture, being the most
empirical of art forms, is far too contingent for our tastes.

I’ve been unsuccessfully trying to convince people to start up a
potluck restaurant with me for over a year now, so it was high time I
transferred that urge into fiction instead. Potluck restaurants wouldn’t
have the high expenses of most restaurants, but the tradeoff is that
they wouldn’t be able to meet basic health standards, without some
pretty thorough screening of the food people bring in.

I’d like to thank one Garrison LeMasters who submitted the
following transcription for <a href="002.html" class="calibre2">strip #2</a>:</p>
<p class="calibre48">
<b class="calibre50">Terror Island %u2014 Strip #2</b><br class="calibre6"/>
Little Dusky Mauve Pawn: Stephen, I think…
(trails off)<br class="calibre6"/>
Dark Ivory Rook (aka Castle):  That’s OK.  (indistinct)
…eat fruit.<br class="calibre6"/><br class="calibre6"/>

[[Except that the c should be in a circle, not between two
parentheses, but I’m just trying to get the flavor of the
whole experience across to you, not actually encode the
experience itself.  That would require a serifed font, and
this is a sans.  Mores the pity.]]<br class="calibre6"/>

Ben and I were, shall we say, <em class="calibre10">quite</em> tempted to leave that
up, but, sadly, things like that would destroy the utility of our <a href="http://www.ohnorobot.com/?comic=495" class="calibre2">search
tool</a>.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
I should note that I have no solid evidence that it was in fact Garrison
LeMasters, except that was the name and e-mail address provided.  So, no
offense meant to the real Garrison if that was a false name.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
This is also a not-too-subtle attempt to remind people that they too
can contribute transcriptions (as some already have) to our <a href="http://www.ohnorobot.com/?comic=495" class="calibre2">Oh No Robot</a> archives.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Lastly, a note of comic recommendation. While I don’t think they
would even notice the possible referrals from here, given their quite
large readership, for the benefit of you, our readers, I would like to
say that <a href="http://www.overduemedia.com" class="calibre2">Unshelved</a> is one of the most
consistently comedically on target comics I read.  Some comics are
kind of hit-and-miss, but Unshelved is just repeatedly and regularly
funny.  And I’m not a librarian or anything, so don’t worry that
working in a library is required for getting it, it’s funny for
everyone, librarian or otherwise.

Not many people know this, but I have secretly been using the constraint
of never photographing the same gamepiece twice.  This means that in
order to complete today’s strip alone, I needed four different copies of
Clue.  Even though you can’t see Sid in the first panel, I had a piece
offscreen representing Sid being on the bus.  Since the bus windows
aren’t opaque, I counted bus shots as including Sid, even though,
technically, the camera didn’t capture him.

The most awesome occupation I ever said I wanted to be when I grew up
was “Puppy Dog.”  This is awesome for three reasons:</p>
<p class="calibre9">First, puppy dogs are
objectively awesome.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Second, <i class="calibre10">puppy dog</i> isn’t a career, it is a type of animal, but
I wasn’t going to let that stop me.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Third, and most importantly, my goal, as a child, for when I grew up,
was to be the canine equivalent of a child.  So, my goal was to not so
much grow up and get a job, as turn into a dog that was roughly the same
age as me.</p>
<p class="calibre9">
So much for childhood dreams.

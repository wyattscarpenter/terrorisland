Did I scare you? Of course not. It isn’t Halloween yet. But next week,
we’ll be starting an all-new Halloween-themed plotline that could last
for one to three strips, depending on how long we want to stretch it
out. Are you prepared for our spooky plans? Again, of course not. Terror
Island Halloween 2006 is going to be the scariest Terror Island
Halloween ever this year!

I was thinking about applying for a fellowship, but apparently the
person who introduced the fellowship left a clause in her will that no
benefit from the fellowship go to persons who or insitutions which
support, advocate, or uphold the principles of Communism.  As a result,
candidates to the fellowship can be required to submit an affadavit,
affirmed before a Notary Public, confirming that they do not support,
advocate or uphold the principles or doctrines of Communism.  And while
I’m not myself a total Pinko, I’m not entirely certain I’m comfortable
swearing before a Notary about my political/philosophical beliefs in
order to get a fellowship.

The title text today was Ben’s idea, but I thought it was super-good.
It gives us yet another answer to my favorite riddle.  The best “real”
answer to the riddle is “Because Poe wrote on both.”  The best answer in
accordence with the dictates of Lewis Carrol’s Nonsense is “Because
there is a ‘B’ in both.”

<p class="calibre9">
The riddle, by the way, is “How is a raven like a writing desk?”

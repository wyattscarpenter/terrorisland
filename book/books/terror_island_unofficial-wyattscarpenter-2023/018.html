Comic-Con just ended last night, and now I’m heading off to Michigan for
a couple weeks. My Internet access will be sporadic there, but I should
be able to get content to Lewis in such a way that our update schedule
will be unaffected.

Since we had a couple strips done before Comic-Con, we are living in the
world of cramped speech bubbles again, but only briefly.

If you are coming here from the Fleen link, there will hopefully be
something on that front later today, technology willing.  Certainly it
will happen early this week.  If you aren’t coming from the Fleen link,
feel free to ignore that.

I’m also going to briefly plug another site of mine here, which
potentially no one but me will be interested in.  I had been reading
webcomics blogs and found myself filled with a desire to post long
comments. Rather than be all talky on someone else’s webspace, I decided
that I would just <a href="http://www.waxintellectual.com/blog/" class="calibre2">set up
a blog</a> on my webspace, so that later, when I want to see the things
I wrote, they’re all in one place.  For instance, instead of posting
about Comic-Con here, I’m going to post thoughts and stuff on that site.
I will say this though, Comic-Con was a lot of fun, and I hope I’m able
to go again next year.

In strip news, Ben and I plotted out Terror Island for a good month of
strips on the
drive back from San Diego, and we have a couple of plotlines that we
know are coming after that.  Which was a lot of fun to plan out, and
will hopefully help keep this fun for us, rather than stressful or what
have you.

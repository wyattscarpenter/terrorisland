You might think that Stephen’s response to the question is odd, since
people watching the debate won’t know who Sid is. But in fact, he’s
fairly well known to Geography City residents who follow politics, due
to being the impetus for most of Stephen’s policy decisions as Czar. In
particular, Ally’s article about Stephen focused on the issue of his
grocery obsession, highlighting Sid’s role to the public.

You know how if someone’s an undercover cop, and you ask them if they’re
a cop, they have to say yes? There should be a movie about a policeman
who’s also a mime, but his mime act keeps getting ruined because of
that.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
[Scene: Police Mime is miming being trapped in a box. An appreciative
crowd gathers, amazed at his skill.]
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Random onlooker: Hey, are you a cop?
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Police Mime: Yes, I am.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Crowd: Boo! You just talked! Boo!

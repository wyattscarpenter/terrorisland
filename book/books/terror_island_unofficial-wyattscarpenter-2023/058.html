You may remember the customers in panel 4 from <a href="053.html" class="calibre2">strip #53</a>.  It’s
nice to see that the one whose lawnmower was stolen apparently doesn’t
hold a grudge. I hope the thief guy doesn’t end up stealing his food.

questions not answered there, <a href="mailto:terrorisland@gmail.com" class="calibre2">feel free to ask us</a>.

You may be wondering some things, like “Why does Jame have a giant
copper ball in his restaurant?” and “Did he really let someone stand on
a ball which was on a table, balancing bread on his head during business
hours?”  The answers to those questions are “I wouldn’t say that he let 
him” and “in case it comes in handy” (anti-respectively).

If the waiter had been around (the waiter being the character
portrayed by the old-school red wooden parcheesi token,
for those of you who can identify game pieces but not follow the
occupations of characters in the strip), I think he would have decided 
that Gunpowder’s salary was likely to be money well spent.

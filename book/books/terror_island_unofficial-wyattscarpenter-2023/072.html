If they had taken Jame’s offer, he probably would have made sure
that the rest of their lives wasn’t a very long time. This is just
speculation, though. Maybe they would have gone on to live long,
happy lives. I don’t know.

The brighter lighting in the first panel is meant to indicate the
idyllic state of not having a demon present. I hope that was clear
enough. If it was, don’t read this paragraph.

What to say about The Wright Brothers.  I mean, hooray for the
pioneers of aviation and all that, but at the same time, if there
had been no Wright Brothers, there would be no stupid layovers in
airports, and you could recline your seat whenever you want, and use 
your tray table <em class="calibre10">all the time</em>.  Insofar as air travel makes
seeing my entire family a possibility, I suppose the frustration is
balanced.  So, Wright Bros., you get off this time, but you had
better be careful, because you might not be so lucky next time.

The Terror Island Riddle from the previous strip has been solved! In
case you don’t remember, the riddle was to figure out how much Hobson’s
Toothpaste costs. ManCat was the first one with the correct answer:
“Legal Defense minus 31 cents.” As he realized, <a href="004.html" class="calibre2">strip #4</a> clearly
established the amount Sid paid for the toothpaste.

I’d like to thank everyone else who posted, wrote in, or otherwise
participated in the riddle challenge, but there are no such people.
Maybe there’ll be more of a turnout for the second riddle challenge,
which will be posted in the next week or so. Until then, have fun
— and happy riddling!

I will have double funny comments next time.  Right now I am trying to
finish my last bit of work for the semester.  Then I get to start on the
work I have to do over winter break.  It’s ok though, I love philosophy,
so I am not complaining.

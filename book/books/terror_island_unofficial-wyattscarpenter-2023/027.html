I was planning for my comments to just be a list of all the monsters I
killed in my most recent NetHack ascension, but that would be over 300
lines long, and most of those lines would be boring.

Regarding today’s strip: York’s answers in the first two panels sure are
unhelpful, aren’t they? I used to do things like that a lot when people
asked me questions. I’ve been cutting down on that a bit, but I still do
it more than so-called “helpful” people.

Ben and I named our planned future comics collective: “Complex
Derivative Comics”.  We have yet to work out any other details.  Except
that he and I will satisfy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy-Riemann_equations" class="calibre2">Cauchy-Riemann
equations!</a> <i class="calibre10">(By the way, that’s Ben’s joke, I don’t actually know
what I just said)</i>.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Also, I want to bring your respective attentions to another photocomic,
<a href="http://perpetualponderings.boldlygoingnowhere.org/" class="calibre2">Perpetually
Pondering version 1.5 alpha</a>, by Grant Farmer.  He said his goal was
to become more popular than us, which (a) wouldn’t be all that hard, and
(b) makes us mortal enemies.  So, be sure to check it out.

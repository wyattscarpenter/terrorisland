A lossy process involves discarding some information. For example, some 
methods of compressing image files will result in multiple similar 
inputs giving the same result, ideally one that looks so much like all 
those inputs that you won’t notice much difference.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
The JPEG format we use to make Terror Island is lossy, which is one 
reason that I keep the original photos around in addition to the strips 
as you see them. The other reason is that I compulsively hoard data in 
general.

The thing that’s great about Wikipedia is that no matter how ridiculous 
of an idea I come up with, they have beaten me to it.  For example, 
tonight, I was talking to Ben about the Four Color Theorem, and how some 
people propose bizarre attempts at counterexamples.  I mentioned that it 
would be more interesting to read someone who, in earnest, kept trying 
to point out that mapmakers have access to many colors, and even the 
poorest of map-makers could easily have upwards of ten or twenty colors 
at their disposal, making the whole question moot.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Suffice to say, Wikipedia was way ahead of me on this, and has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_color_theorem#Not_for_mapmakers" class="calibre2">already 
taken to treating these very serious concerns</a>.  There should be some 
sort of award for being the best at systematically missing the point.  
Something like, “Outstanding Achievement in the Use of Tree-spotting to 
Avoid Forest Observation”.

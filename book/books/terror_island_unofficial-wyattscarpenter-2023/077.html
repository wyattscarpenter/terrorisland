There’s a lot of overlap between Terror Island fans and chess fans, so
you might be interested in Chessudoku, which is basically Sudoku with
added constraints based on chess.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
It was invented by Matthew Skala, the guy who makes the webcomic <a href="http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/bonobo-conspiracy/" class="calibre2">Bonobo
Conspiracy</a>. He wrote <a href="http://ansuz.sooke.bc.ca/books/chessudoku/" class="calibre2">a book of Chessudoku
puzzles</a>, which you can get in printed form or as a PDF. If you kind
of like the idea of Sudoku, but find it a bit uninteresting in practice,
you’ll probably enjoy these chess variants.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
He gets bonus points for using amazons (fairy chess pieces that can move
like queens or knights) in some of the problem types.

<!-- Lewis Comments -->
I have been spending time writing papers.  That takes up a lot of my
time.  Today I used some “Lewis” time to play Guitar Hero, which a
friend lent me.  Turns out it is a remarkably awesome game.  I realize
this is very old news, but it is new to me.

More of you should participate in <a href="http://www.timefan.com/index.php?c=4" class="calibre2">the forums</a>.  They are a
good place to hang out, share recipes, and have a good time.  I assume
that if you are a regular reader of <i class="calibre10">Terror Island</i>, you like
having a good time.

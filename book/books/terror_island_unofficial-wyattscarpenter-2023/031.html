Steve Baphogon of Uranium City wrote in, asking how Lewis and I managed
to come up with such great names for our characters. Well, Steve, there
are two main points involved here.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The first is that in general, I thought of the first names, and Lewis
thought of the last names. However, there are exceptions to this. For
example, I think Lewis named Sid and Stephen, though Sid’s last name
(Byrahk) was my idea.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The second issue is more subtle. In webcomics, it isn’t enough to
just think of a name for a character. You also have to make sure that
the readers learn the names. One tried and true method of achieving this
is to put their names in the dialogue as much as possible. For example,
York’s last line in today’s strip emphasizes that the person to whom he
is speaking is named Liln. Similarly, panel three reinforces the
dichotomous roles of Sid and Stephen.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The most important thing to remember is that the name should fit the
character, not vice versa as in real life. Good luck in your webcomics,
Steve!

First things first, I want to talk about our <a href="cast.html" class="calibre2">cast page</a>.  It is not,
at present, useful for someone who wants to know about the plot of our
comic. It is, in fact, a listing of who/what portrays each of the
characters.  This is useful if you want to know what game the Jame
piece is from (tiddlywinks) or whether the piece that portrays Stephen
is a Sorry piece (no).
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
As a consequence of that, Ben and I agreed we should have a <a href="dramatis.html" class="calibre2"><i class="calibre10">Dramatis
Personae</i></a> for the strip.  So, now there is something useful for
people wanting to find out more about who the characters are, as opposed
to who they are played by.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
We are still going strong in <a href="http://www.webcomicbattle.com" class="calibre2">Webcomic Battle</a>, entering our
tenth day.  There are actually two of our strips up today (<cite class="calibre10"><a href="001.html" class="calibre2">#1</a></cite> &amp;
<cite class="calibre10"><a href="015.html" class="calibre2">#15</a></cite>),
because I assumed we would lose to <a href="http://www.webcomicbattle.com/comic.php?id=1075" class="calibre2">that Waldo
comic</a> and submitted a second strip.  We didn’t lose, and so they are
both in competition today.

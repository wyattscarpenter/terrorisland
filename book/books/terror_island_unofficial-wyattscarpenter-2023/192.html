The Green Grocer is wise to protect his secret identity here, since
for all he knew, Sid might have forgotten about <a href="079.html" class="calibre2">the time he

Since the last update, I’ve gotten some very nice supportive
comments from readers, which have helped cheer me up. You guys are
awesome. Thanks, and have a happy Labor Day.

At one point during scripting, Stephen’s line in panel 3 was just
written as “[wacky guess].”  While Ben was taking photos, I generated a

may ponder how else this strip might have gone.

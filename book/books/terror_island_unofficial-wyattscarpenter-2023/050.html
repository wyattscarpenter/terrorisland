This is our 50th strip, so I celebrated by using a somewhat unusual
speech bubble layout in panel 2.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Oh, see the flag in panel 4? The one that looks cool even though I
didn’t tape it to the wall perfectly? It was designed for us by <a href="http://www.obdormio.com/" class="calibre2">Obdormio</a>, on hearing that Stephen is
a <a href="http://terrorisland.net/strips/017.html" class="calibre2">vexillographer</a>.
We’d been waiting for the right moment to work it into the strip.

We thought of this storyline in June, but you can’t just derive things
in any old order.  You need to build off of your earlier proofs.  This
is what we call model-theoretic continuity, or logical canon.  Between
then and now, it had the status of postulate.  Ben and I don’t publicize
our postulates, largely because we like to maintain a reputation of
infallibility.  Also, if we were pythagoreans or numerologists, we would
be very excited that we could prove this as our fiftieth theorem.

<p class="calibre9">One of my undergraduate professors told a joke about a blind guy and
a swan my sophomore year at the Univeristy of Rochester.  The joke made
no sense at the time, because I didn’t realize it connected up to
something from the reading, and didn’t really understand that thing
anyways, so even if I had made the connection, I still wouldn’t have
gotten the joke.  Then, like last year, I was at a philosohy graduate
student get together thing, and someone was talking about this thing
called the Molyneux problem.  All of a sudden, the joke from three
years prior made sense, which is one of the best humor-related
experiences of my life.  I wish more jokes were so complicated that I
only got them on a three year delay after learning about a philosophical
debate from the 18th century.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Here’s the joke, but you don’t get the explanation: A blind man walks
into a bar, and there is a swan on the table.  He listens to the swan,
feels the swan’s feathers, and smells it. “A ha” he anounced.  “Now I
know what whiteness is.”

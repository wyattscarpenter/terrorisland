I guess it’s a good thing Czars in Geography City don’t have much actual
power.

People have been asking what the deal is with the phrase “Pleased to net
your acquaintance.”  The phrase has its origins one awesome day, when
Ben and I were at UR, and Ben had a net for some reason.  We were trying
to come up with net related puns that one might use while casting the
net over someone (for comedic effect), such as “Net to meet you”
and the like.

<p class="calibre9">
Our often-grumpy friend Reid happened to be around, and I threw the net
at him, saying, “Pleased to <i class="calibre10">net</i> your acquaintance.”  Reid was not
amused by my clever wordplay, nor by the fact that he had had a net
thrown at him.  I think he also pointed out that I already knew him, and
so the line was inappropriate.  The moral of the story is that the
phrase comes from one time that I threw a net at a friend.  In the
Terror Island universe, however, it is the standard greeting, and the
word ‘net’ is used in the sense of ‘acquire’ or ‘obtain.’

Here’s our process, carefully presented in such a way that “Art” is
divided into three of the five steps:</p>

<p class="calibre14">
<b class="calibre11">Step 1: Writing</b> <br class="content"/>
We start by working out the basic premise and then writing a loose
script over AIM. Storyline ideas are worked out months in advance,
but without very many details. We bounce ideas off one another until 
we get something we can agree will work, then try to fit it into
four panels. The punchline usually comes last, and often changes
during the later steps. 
</p>
<p class="calibre14">
<b class="calibre11">Step 2: Staging</b> <br class="content"/>
Next, I take the characters the strip needs, as well as whatever
props we’re using, and set them up on a nearby surface. This can be
as simple as “Sid and Stephen standing next to each other on a
table” or as complex as Jame’s restaurant, where I had tables to
arrange, a hat to make, lights to position, &amp;c. Even that wasn’t all 
that intensive, though, since I don’t spend anywhere near as much
time on this step as a professional-type photographer probably
would. 
</p>
<p class="calibre14">
<b class="calibre11">Step 3: Photographing</b> <br class="content"/>
This is the simplest step. I take a few pictures (generally 10 per
panel), moving the pieces in between as required by the plot. I try
to keep in mind where the speech bubbles will end up being, so that
the composition doesn’t get too messed up, but as you may have
noticed, I don’t focus on this too much. The dialogue tends to
change from the initial script anyway. 
</p>
<p class="calibre14">
<b class="calibre11">Step 4: Photoshop</b> <br class="content"/>
Once I’ve chosen the pictures that I’ll use for the strip, I open
them in Photoshop, add text and speech bubbles, scale them down,
crop as needed, and put them on a template consisting of a white
background with the URL and copyright. Most of the time during this
step is spent tweaking the dialogue to be more ellipse-shaped. 
</p>
<p class="calibre14">
<b class="calibre11">Step 5: Webmastering</b> <br class="content"/>
Once I have the completed file, I send it to Lewis. He lets me know
if he sees any problems with it, and then I fix them. We think up
several ideas for title text, pick the objectively best one, and
then write our comments. Finally, Lewis goes through some process
that puts the strip on the website. I’m not sure how that’s set up.

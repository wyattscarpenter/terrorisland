I’ve just started listening to <a href="http://www.halfpixel.com/ww/" class="calibre2">Webcomics Weekly</a>, a podcast by
<a href="http://www.evil-comic.com/" class="calibre2">Brad Guigar</a>, <a href="http://www.sheldoncomics.com/" class="calibre2">Dave Kellett</a>, <a href="http://www.pvponline.com/" class="calibre2">Scott Kurtz</a>, and <a href="http://www.halfpixel.com/ww/" class="calibre2">Kris Straub</a> about making
webcomics. If you make a webcomic, plan on starting one, or just like
hearing informed people talk about them, you should listen to it.

Some of their tips aren’t relevant to me because I don’t draw, but most
of the advice they have is applicable and interesting. Lots of tips on
writing, composition, character names, and so on.

I have two important things to share today.  One is a list of
underappreciated classic Disney movies that are totally awesome,
compiled from memory.  The other is a
bit of advice.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">The Great Mouse Detective, Robin Hood, The Jungle Book, The Sword in
the Stone, The Black Cauldron, The Emperor’s New Groove.  Did I say “The
Great Mouse Detective”? Oh, I did? Well it belongs on the list twice.
Best Disney movie ever.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">And now for the advice.  Friends don’t let friends read Rand.  You
find her self-interested ethical views appealing? Go to <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen.html" class="calibre2">the
source</a>.  Reading Ayn Rand instead of Aristotle is like reading the
noveliation of “Ghost Dad” instead of reading Hamlet.*  I’m not an
uninformed hater, by the way. I’ve read Atlas Shrugged, The
Fountainhead, We the Living, Anthem, portions of the Romantic Manifesto,
and I have even seen a production of “The Night of January 16th.”  But I
promise you that it is bad to get your Aristotle diluted through a
crazy-person’s championing of robber-barony.  That is all.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
*See, because Hamlet’s father communicates with him as a ghost, but
other than that, there aren’t a lot of important similarities, and
Hamlet is obviously way better.

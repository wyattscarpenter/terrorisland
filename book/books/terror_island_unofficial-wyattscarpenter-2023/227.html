<!-- Ben Comments -->
As you may have noticed, this strip is by Chris Yates, of <a href="http://www.chrisyates.net/reprographics/" class="calibre2">Reprographics</a> fame.
Getting him to do a guest strip is really cool for me, since
Reprographics has been kind of an inspiration for my own photocomicry.
He did a great job nailing our tone with the Terror Elections bit,
too.

<!-- Lewis Comments -->
This strip is, in fact, the canonical explanation of why our comic is
called “Terror Island.” You might think that’s the sort of thing we
should have addressed on our own, but I find it’s more artistically
authentic to allow guest cartoonists a chance at filling in such
matters. It’s like how Plato didn’t write about the nature of morality,
because he knew that Aristotle would do a better job at it later on.
</p>
<p class="calibre48"><i class="calibre52">I wrote Lewis’s comments today. I bet
you couldn’t tell it wasn’t really him, though. I mentioned Aristotle
and everything.

I might as well mention it, since you’d probably hear about it
eventually anyway. Sonty Mick <a href="http://webcomicssobad.blogspot.com/2007/11/terror-island.html" class="calibre2">reviewed 
<cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite></a>, and he said some very cutting and
spiteful things.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
This came as a total shock, especially after I went out of my way <a href="224.html" class="calibre2">a few days ago</a> to
say some kind words about him. Sonty Mick’s really crossed a line here.
I used to like his blog when he was tearing apart other webcomics, but
it’s completely different now that he’s targeting us. How <em class="calibre10">dare</em>
he do this to <cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite>?
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Sonty Mick, I hope someday you’ll go back to criticizing webcomics that
actually deserve it. You used to be funny before you started being so
unfair to me and people like me.

You are no longer the <strong class="calibre11">Terror Island “Pick” of Webcomic Review
Blogs</strong>.

I had hoped no one noticed we were a <q class="calibre2">King of the Hill</q> rip off.
I guess we’re going to work on taking Sonty’s advice.

Lewis and I are both big fans of DC’s Bizarro World comics. It’s a
whacky backwards place where “Dog Bites Man” is more newsworthy than
“Man Bites Dog,” parents punish their kids for getting good grades, the
world government headquarters is in the <strong class="calibre11">Upright</strong> Tower
of Pisa, and women give engagement rings to men! Also, when you say the
drinks are “on the house” in a Bizarro bar, you then fly up and
literally pour the drinks on the house. That’s the opposite of Earth,
where “on the house” is a figure of speech.

My favorite Bizarro moments are as follows.
</p>
<p class="calibre9"><b class="calibre11">Moment the first:</b>  In the opening of one Bizarro comic, they
were doing the usual “things are so backwards/opposite on Bizarro world”
schtick, and one of their examples was that people put bombs in birthday
cakes there.  I was talking with Ben and we concurred that, in fact,
that is the opposite of what we here on Earth do; namely, not put bombs
inside cakes.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
<b class="calibre11">Moment the second:</b>  Immediately before DC had their massive
continuity reboot with the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Alan Moore gave us
one of the greatest Superman comics of all time, “Whatever Happened to
the Man of Tomorrow?”
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
<b class="calibre11">This is your spoiler warning, by the way.</b>
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Bizarro goes crazy, in a way that dwarfs his normal amount of crazy.
Superman is called in because Bizarro is tearing up the town.  Superman
confronts him and asks why he is rampaging.  Bizarro explains, <i class="calibre10">“Ha!
That easy! It am part of genius Bizarro self-improvement plan!”</i>
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
<i class="calibre10">“See, Me suddenly realize that me am not perfect imperfect duplicate!
Maybe me not trying hard enough.  Example: When your planet Krypton blow
up by accident, you am coming to Earth as baby…” “…So me decide to
blow up whole Bizarro world on purpose and come to Earth as
adult!”</i></p>
<p class="calibre9">
Bizarro then takes out some blue kryptonite, which is the kind that
kills Bizarros, and says, <i class="calibre10">“See…you am alive, Superman…And if me
am perfect imperfect duplicate, then me have to be…h-have to
be…”</i>
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
<i class="calibre10">“Uh..everything, him go d-dark…” “Hello, Superman. Hello.”</i>
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Find and read that comic. It is <b class="calibre11">superb</b>.

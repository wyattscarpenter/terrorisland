The unity’s meant to be a funny character or group of characters, but it
actually kind of creeps me out sometimes. Of all the gamepieces we use
in the strip, it seems the most likely to come to life while I’m asleep.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
I wonder if that would mean just three pieces coming to life, or if the
sets of backups I have would also be animated. There could potentially
be nine moving parts, all representing one character.

Ben and I assumed that you can label any stance you want as “preserving
the balance” as long as some sort of eerily knowledgeable character is
the one making the proclamations, since you would need to specify what
is being balanced against what before you could see if it is true or
false.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Luckily, the Unity knows more about what needs balancing against
what in the TIverse than Ben and I do, so we’re just going to follow its
lead.

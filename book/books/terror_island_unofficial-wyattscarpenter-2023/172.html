If <cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite> were a NetHack patch, demonization would
occur when you read a cursed scroll of zombie while confused. Also, the
groceryless conduct (no buying food from stores, stealing it is allowed)
would be tracked.

If <cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite> were a hit television series, the attempt
to demonize Aorist would occur in the final moments of a season finale,
so that you would only see whether it was successful or not by tuning in
again for the big budget season premiere.  Also, we would totally have
the episode where two characters who can’t stand each other get
handcuffed together and stuck in a meat freezer, as well as the one
where a main character accidentally gets married owing to the obscure
customs of a different culture.

This update is coming to you from D.C., where I am. Also, I am
entering these comments on the website, because Lewis is experiencing 
technical difficulties. So these comments are from an unusual source in
two ways.

Anyway, speaking of board games, I played some earlier today, with
Claire and friends. (Ticket to Ride; Hey, That’s My Fish; and Blokus.) 
The books in panel four are Claire’s, but she doesn’t actually keep
them together like that. She does not yet know that I rearranged her 
carefully color-coordinated books for the sake of a comic she
doesn’t read. Seriously, she organizes her books by color.

Last night, I arrived home to discover that my internet connection was
down.  The wonders of technology allowed me to upload the strip and
update the website from <em class="calibre10">my cell phone</em>. That is not a pleasant
way to do the update, so midway through I deputized Ben as assistant
webmaster, and had him finish.

Today’s camera setup involved a type of lighting that some refer to
as ‘an organic flash’.  And no, it doesn’t involve an organ, though
that’s what I thought originally myself.  The particular organic flash
involved in today’s comic happens to also have the neat side-effect of
giving super-powers to certain aliens.  Hooray!

Since this new character is portrayed by a game piece from “Settlers 
of Catan”, this is a good time to mention a story from when I first
went off to college.  A good friend of mine gave me a tiny plastic sheep
figurine, a piece of wood, a piece of wheat, and a brick, as part of my
going away present.  For those of you not in the know, these are the
four resources required to build a new settlement in “Settlers”, and she
was giving them to me to help me get settled at college.

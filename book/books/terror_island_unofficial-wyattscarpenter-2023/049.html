These pictures were taken in Texas, at the house of some of my wacky
relatives.

The reason this front door doesn’t look like the door in <a href="009.html" class="calibre2">strip #9</a>
is that Sid and Stephen live in an apartment with multiple front doors.
This is pretty much standard in Geography City. (It was revealed that
they live in Geography City in <a href="018.html" class="calibre2">strip #18</a>. Try
to keep up.)

Ben has been an amazing deputy over the last couple updates, as my
Internet connection is still out. In fact, astute readers may have
noticed that he wrote my comments on Monday.

<p class="calibre9">
I should add a note to what Ben said today.  Some of you may be wrongly
assuming that an apartment has to be pretty fancy to have multiple front
doors.  And thus, you might be assuming that Geography City is some sort
of richy rich town for rich people.  This is not true.  It turns out
that there is not, in the TI-verse, any correlation between number of
front doors and wealth.  So, for instance, York’s apartment could have a
greater number of front doors than Sid and Stephen’s, without York being
worth more than them, morally or fiscally.

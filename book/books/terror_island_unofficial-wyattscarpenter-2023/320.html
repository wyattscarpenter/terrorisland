You may recall that back when the Czar elections were taking place, 
a fan with a sense of (fiction-oriented) civic duty did cast a vote 
for Blueteen.  While his vote didn’t count because (as we all know) 
Czars aren’t elected, it did win him a place in our hearts.  
Geography City’s only registered Mason asked us to pass along <a href="http://tigerpr0n.com/?p=40" class="calibre2">his plea</a>, and in the true spirit 
of Terror Island, I now pass <a href="http://tigerpr0n.com/?p=40" class="calibre2">that 
plea</a> along to you, despite not really having any idea of what he is 
on about:
</p>
<blockquote class="calibre49">
<p class="calibre9">
<a href="http://tigerpr0n.com/?p=40" class="calibre2">I have a little problem.</a>  It’s
a long story, but I’ll sum up:  I’m trying to organize a bake sale to
help out a debt collection agency.  I want them to sue me for the debt
they think I owe them, but they are reluctant.  I think because they
are worried about legal fees.  I feel like I need to help them out,
since I am involved in this, and since it looks like they are having
trouble working this out on their own, it feels like the neighborly
thing to do.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m doing this in some part for my
own self interest.  I mean I want to see resolution as much as they
do.  So, long story short, I’m organizing a legal offense fund for
them so that they don’t have to worry about the court costs when they
sue me.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
The thing is, I don’t think they know how to bake, and I know for sure
that I can’t… so I am looking to see if there are any volunteers.  I
don’t expect Terror Islanders to actually BAKE anything, I’m not that
silly, but you guys do have a reasonably large following.  So I was
wondering if Blueteen could, you know, get the word out.  Just let
people know that I’m looking for volunteers.

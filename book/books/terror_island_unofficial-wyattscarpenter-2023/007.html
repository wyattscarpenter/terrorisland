I’m not really happy with the way the piece of paper turned out in panel
4. It originally looked darker and slightly blueish, so I adjusted it in
Photoshop. Usually I prefer to leave things as close as possible to the
way they actually looked in real life.

<p class="calibre9">
Firstly, you’ll note I changed it back to “Lewis” from “LP”. That’s
because who was I really kidding?  No one. That’s who.  I am teflon when
it comes to nicknames.  
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Ben asks disapproving questions when I talk too much about things
that aren’t the strip in these notes, so, I guess I’ll answer some
likely questions about today’s
strip.</p>
<p class="calibre9">
You may be wondering, “hey, what if York wasn’t a jerk, and put down
a number, like 6, or even 3?”  That is fairly straightforward. Fork is
closer to even numbers, Heart is closer to odd numbers.</p>
<p class="calibre9">
But, who wins given what York actually wrote?  Sadly, no one.  Heart
and Fork, are, in fact, equidistant from blue.</p>
<p class="calibre9">
And now you know.

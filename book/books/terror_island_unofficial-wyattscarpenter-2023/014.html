Look, this strip has three panels! That was unexpected, wasn’t it? And
on Monday, who knows, maybe there will be five panels. From here on out,
there are no rules.

While Ben is busy showing he’s not slave to the four panel format, I am
going to humbly supplicate you, our readers, for a favor.  I’ve decided
that <i class="calibre10">Terror Island</i> requires, well, more exposure.  And one sure
way to get exposure is Internet drama.  That being said, if you have a
web comic, or know someone who does, and want to stage an entertaining
internet fight with us, we are open to the idea.  Just so long as it has
a decent chance of getting noticed by <a href="http://www.websnark.com/" class="calibre2">Websnark</a> or
<a href="http://www.comixpedia.com" class="calibre2">Comixpedia</a> or what have you.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Also, it would be optimal if you or your friend wanted to be the ‘bad
guy’ in the fight.  Ben and I want to maintain our reputations as
the nice guys of gamepiece photocomics.

<!-- Ben Comments -->
Good news for people who care about planets: the IAU officially
declared that there are only eight planets in the Solar System: Mercury,
Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Some of you may feel that this invalidates <a href="017.html" class="calibre2">strip #17</a>. I
don’t think it does, and that brings me to an important point about
webcomics. One that is brought up in a large percentage of the fan mail
I get for this comic.</p>
<p class="calibre9">You see, for a humor-based comic such as <i class="calibre10">Terror Island</i>, the
joke is the most important aspect of the strip. It’s possible, often
even necessary, to abandon all scientific accuracy for the sake of a
slightly improved punchline. In our next strip, perhaps Stephen will be
a dracula, or Sid’s skin will change color for no reason. Does that
sound crazy to you? Perhaps so. But if it allows us to make even one pun
about blood, or about “feeling blue,” then it’s worth it. In fact, I
would say it’s the point of this journey we’re on. Won’t you join us on
that journey?

<!-- Lewis Comments -->
Ben tries to confuse/appease nitpickers by saying that we abandon
scientific accuracy.  I however, take pride in ensuring the accuracy of
what transpires in <i class="calibre10">Terror Island</i>.  So, I painstakingly ensured
that there was no potential problem with a Pluto/planet joke
(science-wise) before we made it.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
I know what you’re thinking. “But Lewis, how can you claim you take
such care to avoid errors? Your webcomic takes place hundreds of years
in the past, long before the discovery of Pluto, doesn’t it?” And the
answer is, “No, why the hell would you think that?”
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Also, those things Ben said might happen won’t be happening. (1)
Draculas don’t exist in the TI-verse outside of fictional stories
within the TI-verse, and (2) everyone in the strip is both literally and
figuratively color blind, and so, neither racism nor skin-tone based
puns exist in the continuity.

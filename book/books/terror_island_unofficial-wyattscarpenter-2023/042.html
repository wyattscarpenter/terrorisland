Do any of the photographs in today’s flashback sequence look familiar to
you? Believe it or not, they’re actually all authentic copies of the
artwork we used back when the original events were taking place. If you
go through the archives, you can verify this for yourself.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Even though I didn’t have to take any new photos, this strip was
somewhat difficult to make, just because of the flashback writing style.
I suppose that’s the price we pay for not sticking to linear time in
telling the story.

I’ve been watching a lot of <i class="calibre10">Lost</i>, and, as with many ongoing-story
type tv shows, they remind you at the outset of an episode some relevant
plot points.  Ben and I decided that we should do a <i class="calibre10">Terror
Island</i>esque take on “Previouslies”, making use of our
quirky style of flashback-ing.  That way, instead of this being
completely boring recycling of material, it is an inventive recap
which should bring new readers up to speed, and give old readers a
chuckle.  Also, it should give you all some insight into precisely what
the next story arc is going to be.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
By the way, for minimizing your frustration while watching <i class="calibre10">Lost</i>,
I
recommend doing it over a weekend where you can watch all of seasons one
and two in three days.  It makes the constant cliffhangers way less
annoying.

It seems <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tinyfolksings" class="calibre2">Tinyfolk</a>‘s
<a href="http://www.tinyfolk.com/" class="calibre2">national tour</a> is taking him to
California this week. I’m looking forward to seeing him play in San
Francisco tomorrow, and recommend that those of you who live around
there go check it out.

I found out about Tinyfolk a few years ago, when he wrote a song about
me called “<a href="http://factitious.net/otherstuff/An%20Ode%20to%20Ben%20Heaton.mp3" class="calibre2">An 
Ode to Ben Heaton</a>.” I’ve still never met him in person, though.
Perhaps that will change! Expect some sort of comments about this on
Wednesday, unless I forget to go or something.

Earlier today I drove past a car place called “JUST BRAKES and
more.”  All day long I have been thinking about that place, and how
absolutely awful of a name that is.  Since I’ve been thinking about
it all day though, maybe it is a cleverly horrid name, in that it
certainly embedded itself in my mind pretty thoroughly.

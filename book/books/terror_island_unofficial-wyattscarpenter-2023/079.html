I came up with the idea of a supervillain called “The Green Grocer” back
in June, while we were working on <a href="http://terrorisland.net/strips/008.html" class="calibre2">strip #8</a>. Now that I
look back over my records, that was on the same day that we decided on
the Czar plotline. We also scripted part of <a href="http://terrorisland.net/strips/032.html" class="calibre2">strip #32</a> that day.
And, I suggested a joke about Mark Twain that didn’t turn out to be
funny! OK, that last one isn’t very good. But still, several significant
future plot points were decided back then, over a pretty short period of
time. It was a productive day by my standards.

Ben’s days count as productive when three decisions get made in one or
more conversations.

Wow, I was trying to think of more to say, and I almost nodded off while
formulating a sentence.  I guess that means I am tired.

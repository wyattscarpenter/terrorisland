Remember <a href="120.html" class="calibre2">Ned Q.
Sorceror</a>? Also known as <a href="130.html" class="calibre2">the Obvious
Dentist</a>? The <a href="134.html" class="calibre2">interdimensional</a>
<a href="131.html" class="calibre2">supervillain</a>
who bears a grudge against Stephen, Sid, and York after <a href="121.html" class="calibre2">they got him
catapulted</a> out of <a href="114.html" class="calibre2">a Center of the Earth
University reunion</a>? Who then <a href="132.html" class="calibre2">returned to the moon
with the Green Grocer</a> and <a href="140.html" class="calibre2">seized control of the
university</a>, but he and his minions were <a href="141.html" class="calibre2">unable</a> to capture
our heroes before they managed to <a href="144.html" class="calibre2">escape via moon
bus</a>?
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
If you don’t remember him, go read the moon storyline, starting <a href="111.html" class="calibre2">here</a>. It has some
of my favorite <cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite> strips, and quite a few
surprising twists. You’ll never guess what all happens in it.

<!-- Lewis Comments -->
One advantage of studying philosophy is that you get to develop
love-hate relationships with people who have been dead for hundreds of
years.  With David Hume, for instance, I alternate between being totally
impressed by his genius, and basically swearing at him under my breath
after each sentence I read.  I am oddly defensive about Hume though.
When people speak ill of his views, even when I agree that the view is
bad, I am compelled to argue with them and support his position.  I
don’t feel this way about the rationalists, interestingly enough, mostly
just about the British empiricists.

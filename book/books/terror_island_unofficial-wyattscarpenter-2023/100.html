We had a lot of entrants in the 100th Strip Mystery Contest, but none of
them figured out that Bartleby was the one who brought the fruit. Clancy
had the closest guess: “a character we haven’t even met yet.”
Congratulations, Clancy! I’ll give you your prize next time I’m in
Rochester, NY, which is the location indicated on your forum profile.

100.  Wow.  Part of me didn’t think we could sustain the strip this
long.  I mean, when you are brainstorming and your strip’s premise is
that people don’t want to buy groceries, you imagine that you would
pretty quickly run out of ways for them to fail to purchase groceries.
But we have kept it up, no groceries seem to have been purchased,
at least, not by our protagonists, and the strip is coming along quite
well.

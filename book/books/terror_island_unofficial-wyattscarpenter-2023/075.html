When we were planning this strip out, I suggested changing First Folio’s
line in panel 2 to “It must be some kind of alloy!” That way, it would
be a reference to the movie version of Isaac Asimov’s short story
“Nightfall.” The 1988 movie that Asimov hated, not the other one.
</p>

Behind the scenes trivia: when I was writing the previous paragraph, I
had to look up whether the movie was based on the short story rather
than the novel-length version of the short story. I couldn’t tell based
on content, because none of the possible source material had people
using psychic powers to burn snakes, which is most of what I remember
from the movie.

Most people don’t appreciate the importance of reviewing things in
the “Too much X, not enough Y” style of review.  For instance, I TA
a class called “Mind and Self” and the professor mentioned that
after submitting his initial syllabus the first time he taught it,
he was told by the administration that it was “too much mind, not
enough self.”
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
And when I saw “The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe”, my first
response was “Too much witch, not enough lion, sufficient wardrobe.”
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
This has no relation to our comic, which, by all reports, is “not
enough terror, not enough island,” but I thought I would share it
with you all anyway.

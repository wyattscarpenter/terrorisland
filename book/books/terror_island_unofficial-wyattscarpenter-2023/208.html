Ralph Nostradamus writes, “Are those really photographs in your comics?
They look more like drawings to me. Childish drawings made with
crayons.”
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Yes, Ralph, this is a photocomic. Photocomics have a long tradition,
dating back to the early days of either comics or photography, whichever
came first. Notable photocartoonists include such people as Lewis
Powell and Ben Heaton. In conclusion, thanks for writing in.

I would come up with clever comments today, but I was caught off guard
by how engrossing “Heroes” is.  Why didn’t people tell me about it
before?  It is very very good.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
PS: If you did tell me about it before, that doesn’t count because you
didn’t tell me persuasively enough.

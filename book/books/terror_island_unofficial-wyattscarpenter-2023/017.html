Sid could also have said that there are planets in other solar systems
that are farther away. Or he could have pointed out that <a href="http://www.midcoast.com/~martucci/flags/designs/vexigrap.html" class="calibre2">Pluto</a> 
isn’t really a planet (if you want to dispute this, <a href="http://www.timefan.com/?c=4" class="calibre2">our forum</a> would be a good place).
But he didn’t do either of those, because he’s shockingly ignorant of
astronomy.

<a href="http://www.comic-con.org/cci/" class="calibre2">Comic-Con</a> is going very
well. We have received some very good critiques.  For instance, the
roomier speech bubbles (and partial departure from grocery theme) in
today’s strip are based on advice from Bill Barnes, of <a href="http://www.overduemedia.com/" class="calibre2">Unshelved</a>.

<!-- Lewis Comments -->
First off, this strip was literally produced <strong class="calibre11">from
Comic-Con</strong>, which should impress you all.  Not that we do all
our strips as the clock chimes midnight.  We actually have a number of
future strips already made, but Ben brought his camera, and all the
characters (except Omicron), so it seemed foolish not to make one while
here.
</p>
Also, for those of you with a high rating on your curiosometers, 
Comic-Con is pretty awesome. You should all be here.  I acquired, among
other things, both <a href="http://www.starslipcrisis" class="calibre2">Starslip Crisis</a> books, and I met a
number of people who, until recently, were mysterious internet beings.
However, I will have to wait until after the Con is over to give a full
report, with scans of sketches, my impressions, and the like.

Secondly, I felt it important to clear up the terms of the bet which
were not mentioned in the strip.  Had Liln won, Sid would have had to to
refer to his occupation as “The Stumbling Scribe: The superhero whose
power is mediocre writing” but only when talking to potential employers.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
To pre-empt potential confusion, I should also note that, at least
among our cast, it is common practice that when something is left
unspecified (e.g. the location of comparison), whoever calls it first,
may specify.

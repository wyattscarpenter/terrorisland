This set was fun to prepare. There’s a lot more going on in it than you
can see in today’s strip, but don’t worry, you’ll find out more about
Famous Jame’s before we’re done.

The lighting here uses the same clip-on lights from strip #13, but
arranged differently. I should probably get around to acquiring a good
lighting setup for general use, so that I won’t have to rely on the
flash as much as I have in the past.

<!-- Lewis Comments -->
The unit on Aristotle in the class I TA has ended, so people in my
life will probably notice a sharp dropoff in the frequency
with which I discuss Aristotle.

Unless, perhaps, they are distracted by how much I now talk about Hume.

<p class="calibre9">
As for the comic, it seems like Ben and I deduced this plotline a really
long time ago.  I guess it was one of our earlier proofs.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
That reminds me, if you want to use technical terminology, each strip of
the comic is a theorem.  The writing process is called “proving”.  So
instead of saying “Ben and Lewis knew what they were doing when they
wrote strip 25” you could say, “Lewis and Ben made no errors when they
proved Theorem 25.”  This is the sort of thing you could say at cocktail
parties to sound smart and/or awesome.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">By the way, I chose 25 at random.  In case that worries you, I should
clarify that while the strip itself is logically necessary, these notes
are definitely contingent.  As a result, you get a nice mixture of the
necessary with the merely contingent, without diluting the comic itself.
I write my comments by channeling a spirit (luckily, it is my own
spirit).  I think Ben uses haruspicy for his.  You’d have to ask.

I’m in DC right now, as you can tell by the fact that York’s gaming
store is showing up in the strip. (I like to imagine that people watch
the comic carefully to pick up on my movements in real life. Please
indulge me in this notion.)

After I got here, I realized I’d forgotten to bring <a href="http://terrorisland.net/strips/087.html" class="calibre2">my tiny novelty dice</a>,
but fortunately, Claire happened to have some of her own. D20s, even.

<!-- Lewis Comments -->
The ‘c’ key on my keyboard is not working, and I am dealing with this by
a combination of strategies: (1) See if I am able to reword what I want
to type without the key that fails to work, and (2) copy and paste the
letter ‘c’ from other text on the screen.

You had better believe I am getting this looked at in the very near
future.

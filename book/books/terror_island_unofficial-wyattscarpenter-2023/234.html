Who do you think should win the Geography City Czar election? E-mail us
with the name of your favorite candidate at
<a href="mailto://czarelection2007@geographycity.gov" class="calibre2">czarelection2007@geographycity.gov</a>,
and then watch as we pay no attention to your vote, because Geography
City is a fictional place that you’re not actually eligible to vote in.

You guys may not know this, so I will let you in on a secret.  I was the
cutest 3-year-old-child in the history of mankind.  Probably the cutest
one there will ever be.  Now I would prove this to you, if anyone
were to tell me how to do a screencapture of a frame from a DVD played
on a Macbook.  Then I would be glad to show you guys how totally
adorable I am.  Uh, I mean how adorable I <i class="calibre10">was</i>  (I was just
watching some home movies that had been transferred to DVD, and so, felt
the need to share this).

Oh, also, to answer a question about the strip, Stephen has five of the
same tie.  And by same tie, I mean numerically identical.  While this
would be problematic in first-order logic with identity, we like to
think that the logic of Terror Island is a bit better than mere
first-order logic.

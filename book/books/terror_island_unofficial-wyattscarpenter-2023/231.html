The spiral method actually works. I don’t know why people always object
when I suggest it to them.

This strip is based on a real experience Ben and I had driving with our
friend Reid.  Reid was driving, and we were lost in downtown Rochester,
looking for the bus station, I think. Reid, as it turns out, was not as
enamored of the advice, “search outward from here in an expanding
spiral” as Jame appears to be, despite the fact that the bus station
would eventually have been found by that method.

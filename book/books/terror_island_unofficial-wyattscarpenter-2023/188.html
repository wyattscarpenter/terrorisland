I saw <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/" class="calibre2">Scott McCloud</a> give a
talk at <a href="http://www.cartoonart.org/" class="calibre2">the Cartoon Art Museum</a>
today, as part of his <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/makingcomics/tour.html" class="calibre2">crazy
fifty-state tour</a>. Apparently
he only has one state left to go — Nevada. I hope he manages it.
</p>

Also, today’s comic sort of references strips #34 and #41, but since
I’m not linking to them due to laziness, you’ll have to figure out their
URLs yourself.

I’m not one to criticize Sid and Stephen’s plans, but isn’t the Bizarro 
version of someone is pretty much the worst possible choice to imitate
them? It’s like, with anyone else there is at least a chance they might
do a good job, but with Bizarro whoever, you are guaranteed that they
behave the exact opposite in every important respect.

PS: Apparently Ben is the person to go to for your Diatonic Accordian or
Concertina repair information needs.  Interestingly, Ben would have been
the first person I asked if I needed that info before I saw that he
had access to a video about it.

Since I’m not as lazy as Ben (at least not just now), check out these

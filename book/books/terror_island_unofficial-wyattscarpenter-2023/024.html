The set design here is based on what I imagine spelling bees are like in 
Geography City. That’s why there’s no audience apart from the 
contestants. York probably didn’t even send out a press release.

First and foremost: the San Diego Comic-Con <a href="http://www.starslipcrisis.com/ham/" class="calibre2">ham scans</a> are
up. Infinite thanks to Kris Straub of <a href="http://www.starslip.com" class="calibre2">Starslip Crisis</a> for his assistance
and bandwidth. And also to all the artists who participated.
</p>
Welcome to anyone who has been linked here via Starslip or Fleen, or
anywhere else for that matter.  If you want to sample our wares, I
recommend <a href="001.html" class="calibre2">starting
here</a>. <i class="calibre10">Terror Island</i> is a gamepiece photocomic, telling the
story of two roommates trying to decide whose turn it is to go get the
groceries, while their friends variously help or hinder their
grocery shopping related schemes.

I am very very excited about this spelling bee storyline we just
started, as well as the storylines coming up after it.  Then again, I’m
pretty excited about everything having to do with <i class="calibre10">Terror Island</i>,
so, that’s not really news.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BoAS1cvQzwI" class="calibre2">White Town’s
‘Your Woman’</a> is exceptionally good, and a while after it came out,
I completely forgot about it.  I rediscovered it from my friend Dennis’s
music collection, and then again when the video was linked from some
forums I hang out on.  So I figured I’d share it with you all.

<p class="calibre9">
Also, you should all ask Ben about the book I got him for his birthday.
It’s about fonts and morality.</p> 
<p class="calibre22"><i class="calibre13">(note: His birthday was a
while ago, and I got him the book right before Comic-Con, but I
wanted people to know that they make books about font morality)</i>

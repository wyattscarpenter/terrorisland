Ronald Algebra wrote in asking why it is that most webcomics have their
archives in sequential order. That’s a good question, and the answer is
closer than you may think.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
As the well-educated reader will already be aware, Scott McCloud
famously defined comics as “juxtaposed pictorial and other images in
deliberate sequence.” Given that the medium is already sequence-based,
it’s no surprise that the most popular archive structure is one that
reflects this. You could think of the archives of a webcomic as being a
sequence of sequences. It’s almost as if they form a second-level comic,
with webpages as the panels. At least, that’s what we were going for
when we designed the Terror Island site navigation system. Thanks for
writing in!

Many of you are probably wondering who this helpful and inquisitive new
character is. Right now, all you get to know is that the game piece is
from Cranium. Rest assured, though, more information will be
forthcoming.

My birthday is next Friday. I mention this as a service to you, my
readers, who are probably wondering how you can give me a birthday
gift.  Well, friends, the answer is simple.  Nothing says “happy
birthday” like word of mouth advertising for this webcomic.  That can be
your way of saying, “Hey Lewis, this dusty rock we call home completed
another orbit with you alive, have some extra traffic for your site.”
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Increased <a href="http://www.timefan.com/index.php?c=4" class="calibre2">forum</a>
activity is another potential gift. Since those things have a combined
cost of “free”, consider giving both this holiday season.
</p>
<p class="calibre48"><i class="calibre52">Note: Ben pointed out that my birthday
isn’t “really” a holiday.
To that I say: It sounds like somebody has a diet rich in “<a href="022.html" class="calibre2">sour</a>
<a href="030.html" class="calibre2">grapes</a>.”

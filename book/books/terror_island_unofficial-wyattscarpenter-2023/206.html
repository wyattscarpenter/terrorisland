I think Ally is kind of stepping outside the bounds of normal
interviewing practice here. That’s because she’s a loose cannon who
plays by her own rules.

Watch for her upcoming spinoff: “Ally Cs: Maverick Reporter.”

Today’s comic features a triple-callback.  We reference both Stephen’s
election to Czarhood and York’s RPG, but also, we make use of a device
Ben and I are both fans of (though we try not to over use it): the cloud
of objections.  Because sometimes, there is just <i class="calibre10">so much</i> wrong
with a statement made by one of our characters, that we can’t pick
just one.

Bonus title text related anecdote: One time, when watching the movie
“Dead Man” with some friends at the University of Rochester, I was
reminded of the standard third-grade book-report line about Indians
being a hard-working and industrious people who called corn ‘maize’
(this is because “Dead Man” has Indians in it).  I thought using the
word “maize” in the same way Smurfs use the word “Smurf” was very funny,
so I proceeded to use “Maize” with a different meaning in roughly every
third sentence.  At least one of my dormmates was not particularly
pleased by this, but eventually found my childlike glee at using the
term wrong humorous enough to overlook the lack of humor in the joke
itself.  The moral of the story is that I can get away with bad jokes as
long as I myself am entertainingly amused by them.

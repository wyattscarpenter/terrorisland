The Newbery Medal is an award that the ALA gives to authors of American
children’s books. It’s a pretty good award, even though they’ve never
given it to <a href="http://www.pinkwater.com/" class="calibre2">Daniel Pinkwater</a>,
the best author of children’s books. Maybe they don’t realize that he’s
American.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Fun Fact: If Sid’s story wins a Newbery, it will be the first time the
committee has given the award to a made-up work mentioned in a webcomic.

Really, the Newbery should be eternally given to “The Monster at the
End of this Book,” which is universally recognized as the best
children’s book ever created.  Second place is a tie between all the
good Dr. Seuss books and “A Lion for Lewis” which was an awesome book
about a kid who had siblings that did not want to play with him. When
they did let him play, they would be the prince and princess and Lewis
had to be the servant or whatever. So Lewis, our protagonist, leaves
their silly game and looks around the attic, where he finds  a lion
costume.  He then scares his siblings with the lion costume, and they
learn a valuable lesson (about fear, I guess), and let him play for
real, and not have to be the servant.

I know that sometimes I make stuff up for my comments, but that was
really a book I had when I was little.  You know what?  Nostalgia for
childhood is awesome.  I’m starting <a href="http://www.timefan.com/viewtopic.php?p=2785" class="calibre2">a forum thread for
the discussion of children’s books</a>.  Go forth and nostalgize.

Just got back from seeing Iggy Pop play in San Francisco. Putting some
pictures of gamepieces online almost feels like a letdown after all that
<strong class="calibre11">rocking</strong>.

<p class="calibre9">
Almost.

Sometimes I want to share jokes with all of you, but I worry that 
they won’t translate well.  For instance, a while ago, a number of
us in the department were sitting around the philosophy
grad student lounge, talking about a question in metaphysics,
and a possible solution to it.  There were some worries
about how well the solution would work if you had certain other
views, and one of my fellow grads said, “Yeah, but that’s only a
problem for David Lewis” to which another replied, “And
Aristotle.”
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Of course, we all burst into laughter.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
I would explain the joke, but (a) explaining jokes always makes them
less funny, and this one wasn’t actually that funny to begin with,
and (b) I can’t remember what problem we were talking about, or the
proposed solution, or the worry, so if anyone can think of a
philosophical problem, solution and worry about that solution which 
meet the condition “it is humorous that David Lewis and Aristotle
would both have to deal with worry x if offering solution y to
problem z”, please let me know.

Aorist represents the sort of person who will go along with wacky
schemes, but insists on adding his own pointless twist on things. Sid
just wanted him to give a grocery list to Stephen, but Aorist decided to
complicate matters by dressing up like a pirate as well. I’ve known
enough people like that to consider it a stock character type.

I asked Ben what I should write about today, and he suggested
“showering” and then “the distinction between maps and lists”.  We’re
going to talk about the latter, because I don’t have much to say about
showering.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
On second thought, I’m going to talk about our <a href="http://www.timefan.com/index.php?c=4" class="calibre2">forums</a>, because they are
fun and useful.  Ben is a time enthusiast, which I don’t really
understand, but it motivated him to register the domain “timefan.com”
and put up forums there.  For time related discussion.  We decided they
could double as the terror island forums, so that’s where our forums
are.  We have a mnemonic device, though, to make it easier to remember
where the forums are.  “Terror Island: May Each Fan Aid Napoleon.”  So,
remember that to figure out where the forums are.  Or click the button
up top.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">As per my suggestion of fan-factions, one of our fans, Obdormio,
declared himself to be a Stephonian, a bold act which was rewarded with
the title of “Stephonian Prime”.  And that, my friends, is the
sort of zany fun that
can happen on the forums.  It’s also a good place to ask me and Ben
about the strip, or post recipes you like.

Gunpowder was going to tie up Jame, but since that would be a stunt (and
Gunpowder is Jame’s stunt double), he tied himself up instead! Wacky,
huh?
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Panel four took a little while to set up, because it turns out I’m not
very good at tying cubes to things. But on the other hand, tying
yourself up is hard, so it’s reasonable that Gunpowder’s attempts would
look something like that.

I was glad to work a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes_Night" class="calibre2">Guy Fawkes
Night</a> reference into the strip. Stay 
tuned after these comments for a traditional Guy Fawkes Night poem.  And
by “stay tuned after” I mean that you should keep scrolling down.

An interesting thing happened, while scripting this strip.  Originally,
we were thinking that Jame would get tied up, but that wouldn’t jive
well with the upcoming strips.  Lucky for us, when we discovered the
theorem’s true form, we realized that Gunpowder didn’t tie up Jame, he
tied himself up. And as usual, something that looked worrisome at first
wound up working out just fine.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">That’s why I always try and remember that when logical necessity
gives you lemons, its fairly likely that at some point in the future you
will be able to prove lemonade.

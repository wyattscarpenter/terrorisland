If you read a lot of webcomics, you may have noticed that some of them
have been announcing the fact that they’ve been nominated for the <a href="http://www.ccawards.com/" class="calibre2">Webcartoonists’ Choice Awards</a>. We
didn’t get nominated for those. At all. But we <em class="calibre10">did</em> get
recognition from the <a href="http://factitious.net/index.php?title=Factitious_Webcomic_Awards" class="calibre2">Factitious 
Webcomic Awards</a>! <cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite> won both <strong class="calibre11">Best
Gamepiece Photocomic</strong> and <strong class="calibre11">Best Use of Live
Cats</strong>. I can assure you that I’m just as honored as you are
impressed.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
What’s more, the FWAs are awarded monthly, so we have a good chance of
winning again in a few weeks. Now that’s efficient!

I was thinking how awesome cartoons used to be, and how much I
missed out  on some really good ones.  Like, the one where the main
character was a superhero musician who fought against an evil rock
group.*  Truly outrageous.  Anyways, I am also slightly saddened
that I missed out on the new Ninja Turtles tv show, because
according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_%282003_TV_series%29" class="calibre2">the
plot synopsis off of wikipedia</a>, it is the greatest
story ever told.**
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
*I am just guessing that this show is awesome based solely on the
premise.  I haven’t actually seen it.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
**The greatest story about turtles with ninja training, at least.

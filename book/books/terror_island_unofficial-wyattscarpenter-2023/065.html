People often ask me how I get the props that end up in the comic. To
demonstrate that it’s easier than you might think, I took the pictures
for this strip using nothing but common household items. You too can
create “Sid’s secret room” in the comfort of your own home, using
nothing but an eye-themed novelty clock, a miniature Turkish-English
dictionary, a wax <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_stellated_dodecahedron" class="calibre2">small
stellated dodecahedron</a>, and whatever else was in panel four. I
forget the details.

<p class="calibre9">
Next week, I’ll explain how to make your own “Stephen’s secret room.”

This one time*, David Hume said, <i class="calibre10">“Whatever has the air of a paradox,
and is contrary to the first and most unprejudic’d notions of mankind,
is often greedily embrac’d by philosophers, as shewing the superiority
of their science, which cou’d discover opinions so remote from vulgar
conception. On the other hand, anything propos’d to us, which causes
surprize and admiration, gives such a satisfaction to the mind, that it
indulges itself in those agreeable emotions, and will never be perswaded
that its pleasure is entirely without foundation. From these
dispositions in philosophers and their disciples arises that mutual
complaisance betwixt them; while the former furnish such plenty of
strange and unaccountable opinions, and the latter so readily believe
them. Of this mutual complaisance I cannot give a more evident instance
than in the doctrine of infinite divisibility, with the examination of
which I shall begin this subject of the ideas of space and time.”</i>

That may be the best introductory paragraph ever written.  And its not
even the introduction to <i class="calibre10">The Treatise</i> itself, its the
introduction to the first section of the second part of the first
book of <i class="calibre10">The Treatise</i>.

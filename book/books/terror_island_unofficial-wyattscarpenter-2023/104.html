It was nice getting to work with a different scale for this strip. The
pig and turtle are closer to the size of the rocks from FOMS than they
are to gamepieces. I think of this size as “small” and the usual Terror
Island scale as “tiny.” This may not be quite how those terms are used
by others, but it means that I can say, for instance, “I need to get
some tiny chairs” and know exactly what I mean.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
When we planned out this strip, I was actually thinking about using tiny
objects for the characters, but at the last minute, I decided that I
liked the way this pig looked better. Maybe the tiny pig and turtle will
end up being used for something else.
</p>
By the way, my term for Omicron’s scale is “normal-sized.”

This is the fairy tale Stephen commissioned, in case you are very
confused.

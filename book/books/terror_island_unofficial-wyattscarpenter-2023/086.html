Today is December 29th, and you know what that means. That’s right, it’s
been 200 days since we started Terror Island!
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
If days were years, this would be the Terror Island Bicentennial. But
since days aren’t years, the actual bicentennial celebration is going to
have to wait until 2206. I’m looking forward to it.

Ben and I decided that after wrapping up the demon plotline that it was
time to get back to basics.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">I decided that all-you-can-eat-make-your-own stir fry is excellent,
and Guitar Hero II is an addiction.  Also, Wii is the most brilliantly
designed game system ever, based on playing like, a half hour of Wii
tennis. And that’s just some random game that came with the system (I
don’t have a Wii, but my friend Elliott does, and he was gracious enough
to let me get my ass kicked at Wii tennis).

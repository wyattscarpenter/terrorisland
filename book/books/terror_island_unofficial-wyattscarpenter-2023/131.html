Fran Seabane writes in, asking, “Why doesn’t your webcomic update every
day? I want to see more than three strips a week!”

I’m glad to know you want more Terror Island, Fran! But the reason we
only update on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays is that our traffic data
shows that more people visit the site on those days. Admittedly, I may
have the direction of causation backwards there, but there is definitely
a causal link.

You can tell that The Green Grocer is fairly brave, since he was willing
to fight The Obvious Dentist even though The Obvious Dentist has the
advantage of having actual super powers.  I would suggest that the
henchmen balance that out, but the odds are that they wouldn’t
participate in the fight, so much as give insightful analyses of the
quips traded between the combatants.

The “fruit salad” Stephen made actually consists of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grapes_of_Wrath" class="calibre2">this</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange" class="calibre2">this</a>. Don’t
click on those links if you’d rather work it out for yourself. They
contain spoilers.</p>

Originally, there was going to be a bit where Sid was eating a book, and
said that it was too chewy. Then Stephen would tell him not to judge it
by the cover.

Today I bring you fan-news and a crazy Ben anecdote.</p>
<p class="calibre9">
First, we’ve been <a href="http://hawaiianshirts.livejournal.com/46599.html" class="calibre2">adoringly ripped
off</a>.  If you are curious about the punchline of that fan strip, I
direct you to <a href="http://factitious.net/index.php?title=Goat_Plague" class="calibre2">an
explanation</a>.  And, yes, if you check those credits, they make it
clear that I was director and Ben was <i class="calibre10">merely</i>
<strong class="calibre11">co</strong>director.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
And now the anecdote.  One time (October 7, 2004), Ben had introduced me
to wikipedia. And I had never come across the word “neologism”, which
gets used a lot on wikipedia when people want to delete articles.  So I
send Ben an IM (he lived on the same floor as me at college, but in a
different suite).
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
(18:56:11)ultralewis:what is neologism?<br class="content"/>
(18:56:19)factition:Neologism?<br class="content"/>
(18:56:28)factition:Lewis, that’s a word you just made up.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Then he runs to my room, to see my reaction and make sure I got the
joke.  At which point I say, “Ben, how long have you been waiting to use
that one?”  To which he replied “two years”.</p>
<p class="calibre9">And I believe him.</p>

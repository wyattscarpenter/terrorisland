It was tricky to come up with a way of denoting that the first three
panels are photographs, since the panels in <cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite>
are always photographs already. Using Polaroid-type borders around them
would have been good, except that the aspect ratio is off, and it might
blend into the white background of the strip.

Just so everyone knows, in about two years, the strip is going to be
Gunpowder waking up and realizing that it was all a dream.  Or was it?
Then we’ll pull back the shot and reveal that Stephen is actually
watching the whole thing on a television inside a snow-globe.  And then,
just when you thought the twists couldn’t get any twistier, we’ll reveal
that Sid and Stephen are actually the same person, and
that they have been dead all along.  Since people sometimes complain
that twists like this seem unplanned and forced, I wanted to make sure
everyone knew that this has been in the works since day one.  Or, well,
whatever day today is.  The point is, you can enjoy the whole remainder
of the series knowing that it is all the televised entertainment of the
fever-dreams of a ghost with multiple personality disorders.

Also, for anyone doing literary analysis of the strip, it is about
man’s inhumanity to man.  But it isn’t saying anything interesting about
it.  It isn’t even making the worthwhile observation that man is,
sometimes, inhumane to man.  If anything the strip is conveying the
claim that Man is inhumane to man if and only if man is inhumane to man.
While not as interesting as the observation or comment on actual
inhumanity, it has the advantage of being tautologous, and therefore
indisputable

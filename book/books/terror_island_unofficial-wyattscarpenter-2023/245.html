<!-- Ben Comments -->
The reason the ground looks different from last strip is that it rained
today. That’s one of the hazards we risk when the comic’s set outside.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
One problem I ran into while photographing it was that wet surfaces
reflect light differently from dry ones, so the lighting setup I was
using was producing too much glare on the ground. Moving the light to
different angles didn’t help much, and I started thinking that it would
be great if I had some thin cloth I could drape over it, to diffuse it a
bit. But the strip was already taking longer than expected, and I didn’t
want to head all the way back inside to pull out more equipment. Then I
realized that the solution was right in front of me — or rather,
right on me.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
The point is, I’m willing to sit around shirtless in the rain at night
if that’s what it takes to provide you, the reader, with the comic
you’re used to.

I never have to take my shirt off in the rain, because I’m a
<em class="calibre10">writer</em>. I think I’m so great.

The original idea here was that Sid and Stephen would have birthdays
that occurred outside time, but Lewis thought that was “too weird.” I
may write some Terror Island fanfic exploring their atemporal origins
later.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Oh, and the blindfold idea came from the fact that in Nethack,
blindfolding yourself is often useful. I’ve been playing a lot of
Nethack lately.

I guess I will do a little bit of “what’s our process” exposition.  A
<i class="calibre10">Terror Island</i> strip begins usually as a half baked idea of mine
or Ben’s.  We’ll take <a href="011.html" class="calibre2">strip 11</a> as an
example.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
That strip began with my saying to ben, “we should also have one where
one guy puts a bunch of books in the fridge, and claims he went 
shopping, and its the other guys turn.”  Ben replied, “And then the
other guy eats one to make a point.”  (This was back in early June,
before the strips had even started being put up and made, so that’s why
we’re saying “one guy” instead of “Sid” or “Stephen”).  Then I proposed
the punchline, “Pride and Prejudice is delicious.  Please just go buy
some grapes.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
A day later (June 9th), we were discussing what book would be funniest
to eat, and considered:
</p><ul class="calibre46">
<li class="calibre36">Pride and Prejudice</li>
<li class="calibre36">Paradise Lost</li>
<li class="calibre36">Don Quixote</li>
<li class="calibre36">Gravity’s Rainbow</li>
<li class="calibre36"><i class="calibre10">And many more…</i></li></ul><p class="calibre9"></p>
<p class="calibre9">One joke we didn’t get to use, but I liked was the idea that they ate
“Characters in Conflict” a book of short stories exemplifying the four
main narrative structures, “Man vs. Dairy”, “Man vs. Meat”, “Man vs.
Fruit” and “Man vs. Grain” (that is a real book, but a fake
description of it).</p>
<p class="calibre9">
So, we decided on Gravity’s rainbow, and worked out a rough draft
script.  Then we both think about the script, and come back with
suggestions.  Ways to punch it up.  Sometimes my scripts that I send to
Ben instead of dialogue in panel four say, “Insert Punchline”.  And
often, they have way too much dialogue.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
The script for eleven went through several revisions, Ben was pushing
for a “judge a book by its cover” joke, and I (odd though it may be) was
kind of pulling for a pun like, “Needs a Pynchon of salt”
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
We weren’t quite satisfied with either joke, so we starting thinking of
other famous books and authors, and we noticed that some fairly popular
books have food names in the titles.  It was at that point that the
script you see fell most of the way into place.  Then we modified it
based on space constraints, and Ben did some voodoo magic or whatever,
and then, I posted the comic on the site.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
So I hope that’s an interesting bit of anecdote for you, and lets you
see that Ben and I have to sacrifice some gags we both like because they
aren’t quite right for the strip.  Most of them don’t have much reuse
value, as they are too close to gags we actually go with.  This is lucky
for me because it gives me something to put in the comments.

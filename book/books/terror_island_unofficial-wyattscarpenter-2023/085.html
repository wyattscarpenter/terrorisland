<!-- Ben Comments -->
I received a letter from loyal reader Leo Backgammon, who writes: “I
design toothpaste tubes for a living, and Ben’s comments on <a href="http://terrorisland.net/strips/084.html" class="calibre2">strip #84</a> make no
sense. It’s almost as though he has no idea how toothpaste works, and
was just rambling in order to fill space.”

Thank you for writing in, Leo. The ease of communicating with fans is
one of the things I like most about webcomicry. However, regarding the
points you raised in your fan letter, I disagree completely.

Our normal update schedule does not work as well when Ben and 
I are two hours apart.  We got this one done, but I was already
supposed to be asleep by the time we finished.  Basically, my
comments would be some clever jokes and then instruction for you to
vote for us in the <a href="http://www.webcomicbattle.com" class="calibre2">webcomic

Some of our readers may take issue with the portrayal of Socrates as 
a villain. That’s all well and good, but I put it to you, dear
reader: is it not the case that Socrates was villainous in nature?
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Reader: Surely he was, Ben.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
And would you agree that one who is villainous is, by definition, a
villain?
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Reader: To doubt that would be madness.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Then does it not follow that Socrates was in fact a villain?
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Reader: Now I see clearly; you have pointed out the error of my
ways.

I was as surprised as anyone that it is logically necessary that
Socrates is the paradigm case of a villain.  That’s the beauty of
doing a discovered comic.  You learn a lot of things that you might have
thought were empirical in the process of making it.

Ben didn’t give me notes for today’s strip, so this was my best guess as
to what he
would have wanted to say — Lewis

I think this strip represents something of a turning point, but instead
of talking about that, I am going to share with you all one of my
favorite jokes:</p><blockquote class="calibre49">Q: What do you get if you cross the Atlantic
with
the Titanic?<br class="content"/>A: About halfway.</blockquote>
<p class="calibre9"></p>
<p class="calibre9">I will say one thing about this strip.  If you were to describe some
of what goes on in <i class="calibre10">Terror Island</i> to someone, they could come away
with the opinion that Sid and Stephen are tricksy by nature, and
basically just like to scheme.  I think this strip reveals that we are
not dealing with two people who just like to trick each other.  For Sid
and Stephen, this dispute really is about the groceries.</p>
<p class="calibre9">By the way, if you have feedback on the strip for us <a href="http://www.timefan.com/index.php?c=4" class="calibre2">tell
us in the forums</a>.  Seriously, even if you think our comic is bad,
and that our sense of humor is awful.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">And if you like our sense of humor, you should check out <a href="http://eastmostpeninsula.com" class="calibre2">Killer Robots from Space</a>, which
I think is funnier than me and Ben.  Well, definitely funnier than me,
and probably funnier than Ben.  At any rate, its good, so go read
it.</p>

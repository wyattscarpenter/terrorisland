With this strip, I was going for more of a continuous set than
usual. My initial impulse was to make the checkout aisle and the
shelves of food as two separate locations, and just cut from one to
the other. But this way makes it feel more like a real place, and also
took up a bit less space in my basement.

Terror Island Riddle: Sid received 31 cents in change. So how much
does that mean the toothpaste cost? Believe it or not, it’s possible 
to figure this out, but you may need to look through the archives a
bit.

I’m trying to get some new slang started.  Whenever you think
something is bad, you should call it “widdershins.”  As in, “Having
to shave every day is totally widdershins.”   Widdershins currently
means counterclockwise, but seriously, it needs a much more useful
meaning, I think.

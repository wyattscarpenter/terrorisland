I guess Florian and Gavriel just wander into Sid and Stephen’s house
whenever they want. It’s not like anyone’s going to be able to stop
them.

Oh, for those of you who want to “chat” with fellow <cite class="calibre10">Terror
Island</cite> fans, we have an IRC “chatroom” now. Just point your IRC
client at irc.freenode.net, and join #TerrorIsland. If you don’t know
how to use IRC, then ask a friend for advice or something. Friends love
that.

I got a phone call tonight from my friend Leland that went like this:
“Hi Lewis.  What is Buffy’s last name?”  “Summers.”  “And what high
school did she go to?”  “Sunnydale.”  “OK, thanks.  Bye.”  I don’t know
why Leland needed those two facts, and while they aren’t the most
obscure bits of Buffy trivia, I am pretty proud of the fact that I am
the person to call for Buffy trivia.

Unrelatedly, when I flew to Chicago, I accomplished something pretty
interesting.  I’ve been trying to read “Cryptonomicon” for about four
years now.  Several times, I read up to about page 70, got busy, and put
the book down long enough that I would have to start over when I picked
it back up.  Well, this time I broke the page 70 barrier, and am
actually now over halfway through the book (600 pages out of 1000).
I suppose describing this as an interesting accomplishment may have been
misleading, but what can you do?

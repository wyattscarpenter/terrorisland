A reminder for those of you who forgot my comments from a few days ago: 
my new photocomic, <a href="http://www.requestcomics.com/" class="calibre2">Request 
Comics</a>, is still new and exciting.

Now with three strips up! Still no RSS feed, though. I’ll see about 
doing that this weekend.

It is important to remember that Sid and Stephen aren’t even super 
heroes, so they get a x8 multiplier to their scores for defeating a 
council of supervillains.  Defeating a council of supervillains is 
normally adds half again as many points to one’s score as one already 
had, however, sadly, the recursive rules for scorekeeping don’t include 
a base case.  While we know that their scores are now (x + 8*(x/2)) 
where x is their previous score, there is simply no fact of the matter 
as to what their current scores are.

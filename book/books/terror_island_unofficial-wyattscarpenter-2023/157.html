We’ve been making <cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite> for a year now, and I think
we’ve both learned a lot along the way. But this learning process never
really ends. Over the years to come, <cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite> will
continue to grow and evolve, as we further refine the art/craft of
gamepiece photocomics.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
One thing I learned only recently is that Icehouse pieces are really
well-built. They can take more damage than you’d expect before breaking.
I’m not sure how this knowledge will aid <cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite> in
future strips, but it’s handy to know anyway.

To borrow the internet’s favorite  exclamatory interrogative: WTF?

<p class="calibre9">
I had no idea this was coming. I have been caught totally
off guard by this turn of events, and I don’t know who to turn to or
blame.
</p>  
<p class="calibre9">However, when I stop and think about it, it was foreshadowed pretty
clearly in an earlier strip.  35 points to the first person to correctly
identify the relevant foreshadowing.  As always, guesses should be
posted in the forums.

<a href="http://www.lordfungusman.museum/" class="calibre2">One of our fans</a> sent me
an Instant Message today, complaining that
recent strips are boring, and that Terror Island “has lost the wit and
charm it once had.” We haven’t done anything to address these concerns.
And we never will.

I was particularly happy with the line “toothpaste isn’t groceries”
because of the non-agreement in number (“toothpaste” is singular,
“groceries” is plural).  I don’t know why this made me happy with the
line, but it seems to be the thing that tickled my fancy.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
I am still not happy with our current level of critical acclaim.  See,
since the strip’s humor isn’t really accessible to the masses, or even
sometimes to Ben and myself, we have basically two remaining avenues to
pursue: (a) being the favorite of the intelligentsia in the webcomics
community, or (b) being a cult phenomenon.  I guess I’d be ok with (b),
but, really, that’s more like kids in the future unearth the strip and
get a ‘retro’ kick out of pretending they like it.  I’d much prefer (a),
first off, because it involves actual people sincerely saying nice
things about the comic now, rather than hypothetical robot space kids
ironically saying them in the future.  
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Right now our acclaim consists in being able to quote
<a href="http://www.clango.org" class="calibre2">R Stevens</a> as saying the comic is
“pretty good,” from the San Diego Comic-Con last year, an IOU for a
review from the <a href="http://webcomicker.blogspot.com" class="calibre2">Webcomicker</a>, and that’s about
it.  So, if you are a webcomic reviewer, or would like to be one, why
not get started with our strip?  Another potential story:  Why are both
creators of <i class="calibre10">Terror Island</i>, a relatively new webcomic, on the
<a href="http://www.ccawards.com" class="calibre2">WCCA</a>
planning committee? (Note: hard hitting reporters, this is a chance for
your big break)
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Last note: <i class="calibre10">Guitar Hero</i> got inside my head.  To the point where
I realize I am subconsciously doing the strumbar and frets for
“Crossroads” or “Infected” while walking through a grocery store.  And
when I close my eyes, I can see the colored discs and trails of “Take it
Off” flying at me.  Plus I catch myself singing the guitar part to
“Cochise” every so often.  So, you know, be warned about the
addictive tendencies of guitar heroism.

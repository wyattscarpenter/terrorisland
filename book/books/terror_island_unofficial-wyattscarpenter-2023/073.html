<a href="http://www.superosity.com/" class="calibre2">Superosity</a>‘s been around for
nearly eight years, and it just now got around to the plot point it’s
named after. Check out Boardy’s line in the first panel of <a href="http://www.superosity.com/d/20061128.html" class="calibre2">yesterday’s strip</a>.
I have a feeling this storyline will involve some major changes. If
you’re not already reading Superosity, this is probably a good time to
start.

I think this demon is particularly well suited to possessing Jame.
Which is to say, I think there is a nice symmetry between Jame’s
inability to completely fit in with Liln’s friends, and this demon’s
inability to demonize effectively.  You sort of imagine that if he
explained what happened in this strip to his demon friends, they would
say something like “Sounds like you’ve got a case of <i class="calibre10">idle hands</i>.”
Or, “Have you tried looking harder for work?” and then the demon would
have to say, “what? I don’t get it.” and the other demons would say,
“You know, work to put those <i class="calibre10">idle hands</i> to.”

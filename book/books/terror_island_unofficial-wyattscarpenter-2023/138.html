I probably spend more time tying gamepieces to things than almost anyone
else. You’d think I’d be better at it than this.

I am reading a book right now by a philosopher named Graham Priest.
It is called <i class="calibre10">Toward Non-Being</i> and it is defending the claim that
some things don’t exist.  Some people find that to be an obviously false
thesis.  Some people can’t believe it is in doubt.  What is important to
note is that Priest is not saying that there are non-existent objects
(that would be silly, he admits).  He only wants to say that some
objects don’t exist.

Yeah, philosophy is pretty awesome, in case you were wondering.

This was a fairly elaborate setup, compared to previous strips. In
addition to the sign and the fake groceries, I had to set up some lights
above the set in order to get the lighting right. I think this way, it
comes across looking like an apartment that was inexpertly made to look
like a grocery store.

Time for more tales of BEN.  This story, I think, shows part of what
makes ben so awesome and yet also more than a little frightening.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
So, I suggest a primitive version of the plan in the above comic to Ben 
while we are brainstorming plots, and he <i class="calibre10">immediately</i>
replies:</p>
<p class="calibre9">
8:49:28 PM factition: I have access to some small fake plastic
groceries.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
I like to think he is a powerful psychic who uses his powers only to
anticipate my ideas for plotlines for the comic, and purchase tiny
groceries accordingly.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Now for the part where I talk about things only sort of related to the 
comic.  There is, or rather, was this awesome band, “Splashdown”.  They
stopped being a band and decided to let people put their music on the
internet for sharing. You should all download <a href="http://www.sadena.com/music/splashdown/" class="calibre2">“Blueshift”</a>
and enjoy listening to a very good band.  I owe my awareness of this
band to <a href="http://www.malsyned.net" class="calibre2">my good friend Dennis</a>.
The whole album is good, but I particularly recommend <a href="http://host78.ipowerweb.com/~bellas-w/TX/splashdownjanuary/Blueshift/Splashdown%20-%20Blueshift%20-%2011%20-%20Waterbead.mp3" class="calibre2">Waterbead</a>
and <a href="http://host78.ipowerweb.com/~bellas-w/TX/splashdownjanuary/Blueshift/Splashdown%20-%20Blueshift%20-%2012%20-%20Procreation%20Chick.mp3" class="calibre2">Procreation
Chick</a>. Strictly speaking, that wasn’t even a little bit related to
the comic, but I think we can all be ok with that.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
One last note: I found out that my friends who I never talk to because
I’m generally a horrible person when it comes to keeping in touch with
people who are far away from where I am read and enjoy the comic.  So
these comments are dedicated to Elliott and Jenny.  I’d dedicate today’s
strip, but then I’d have to talk to Ben about it, and he doesn’t know
them.  Also then I’ll have to let him dedicate a strip to someone
sometime, and it will be, like, a 16th century Italian mathematician or
something.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
<i class="calibre10">Ben wanted me to make “16th century Italian mathematician” <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niccol%C3%B2_Fontana_Tartaglia" class="calibre2">this
link</a>.  Needless to say, I didn’t.</i>

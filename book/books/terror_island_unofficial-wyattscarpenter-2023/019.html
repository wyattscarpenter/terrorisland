Fun Fact: The shadows moved almost an inch between panels 3 and 4, this
was done so that the careful reader would note the passage of time as
Liln considered Sid’s plan.

Fleeners:  Getting access to a scanner is less easy than I anticipated,
but check back Friday, when I will definitely have an update on that
front.  It may be done before then, but I don’t want to give a false
promise.

Secondly, Ben and I invented an awesome game at Comic-Con.  They were
handing out Galaxy Press promotional decks; playing cards with summaries
of L. Ron Hubbard stories on them.  Ben and I invented “Hubbardopoly” in
which you split up the deck between you and another player, and proceed
to draw cards (as in the game war).  You then read the plot summaries,
and whichever player drew the more ridiculous plot, wins the trick.  The
player to collect the most tricks wins.  Those cards gave us at least an
hour of entertainment that way.  Sadly, most of the stories they
described were not yet published, and so Ben and I could not get the
book about the guy who acquires an island in the pacific only to
discover it is haunted by a shark god.

Also a comic-con update: <a href="http://www.dieselsweeties.com" class="calibre2">R.
Stevens</a> said that he liked our comic, and <a href="http://www.pvponline.com" class="calibre2">Scott Kurtz</a> kind of
implied that he didn’t so much like our comic, by making a face and
shaking his head when R. Stevens said he liked it.  This was
during the webcomics 102 panel, so, there were lots of witnesses.
Sadly, no one said the name of our comic, or the URL, so we didn’t even
really get any press (bad or good) from being discussed at the panel.

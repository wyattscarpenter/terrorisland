Look, a piece of paper with tiny lines on it! That takes me back. In the
early days of <cite class="calibre10">Terror Island</cite>, we used to have a new random
paper prop every week or so. I still have all of them.

I am a great discoverer, like Ferdinand Magellan or, umm, that guy who
made dynamite out of bread mold.*  I, my good friends, discovered
<b class="calibre11">tea</b>.  Maybe I’m more like Columbus discovering the New World,
since I am far from the first person to discover tea.  However,
recently, I adopted a rule to drink only water.  That was good until
drinking only water got very boring.  I decided that tea was about the
closest to water a beverage can get, and also I’d been hearing good
things about it.  So, I started drinking tea.  Some teas are quite
delicious.  I am still exploring the various types of tea, but red teas
and mint teas have been pretty good so far.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
In conclusion, if they give out awards for excellence in the field
of discovery, I think I deserve one of them, since tea is, I think we
can all agree, a worthwhile thing to discover.

*I am fully aware that Nobel invented dynamite, and that the bread mold
thing was penicillin.  This was just some of my patented humor stylings.

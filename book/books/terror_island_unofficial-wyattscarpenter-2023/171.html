Lately I’ve been seeing a surprising number of books using unusual
ligatures in the text on their back covers. It goes well beyond the
standard f ones — I’m looking at a book right now
which has ct, gi, ip, it, sp, and st ligatures just dropped in casually.
I think I’ve seen this done on books from multiple publishers, too. Is
there some recent fad for that sort of thing? I like ct and st
ligatures, but the others look pretty distracting to me.

I saw Transformers tonight.  I think it was as bad as a movie could be
without accidentally being bad enough to generate some ironic value.  I
have also decided that Roger Ebert’s opinion is worthless because
instead of saying that Transformers was one of the worst films ever, he
said positive things about it.  Now, I didn’t go see it on his
recommendation or anything, but anyone who came away from that movie
with something other than disgust or revulsion has thereby lost all
credibility on the quality of anything having to do with movies.

And now, the Bizarro Aorist’s backyard set will be dismantled, never to
be seen again.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
I feel like that famous sculptor who destroys all his works a week after
making them. And also his works are all made of gamepieces and stuff he
found in the basement. And he isn’t even a little bit famous.

<!-- Lewis Comments -->
One time, I went on a date, and the first thing my date said to me was,
“If I stop breathing, I need you to stab me.”
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
This was because she had a <i class="calibre10">severe</i> peanut allergy and didn’t want
to die on the date in the event that the restaurant was not 100% good at
keeping peanuts out of her food.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
Oh, and the thing I was supposed to stab her with was an epinephrine
injection.
</p>
<p class="calibre9">
I wish more of my dates started off so enigmatically.

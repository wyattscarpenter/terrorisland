<!-- Ben Comments -->
My fans often ask me what the hardest part of making a webcomic like
Terror Island is. I would say it isn’t any one thing — it’s not
the photography, or the writing, or even the panel layout. No, the hard
part is synthesizing all these to form a unified whole. That’s why
working with Lewis is so helpful to my process. I’m able to take the raw
material of his ideas and shape it to fit my underlying vision for the
Terror Island world and all its wacky characters.</p>

<p class="calibre9">I hope that answers your question, and thanks for writing in. It’s
always good to hear from fans like you.

Ben’s comments may be somewhat misleading, insofar as they could be
taken to imply that he has been asked that question often, or, say, at
all.

<p class="calibre9">
Sometimes, though, people don’t ask us enough questions, and that’s
when it is time for us to make some up.

We’re still going strong at <a href="http://www.webcomicbattle.com" class="calibre2">Webcomic Battle</a>, Sunday we
unseated the thirty-something day champion strip, and so that was
exciting.

Ben has a <a href="http://factitiouslj.livejournal.com/11937.html" class="calibre2">convincing
argument</a> that Pluto isn’t a planet, by the way. Or
rather, that “planet” shouldn’t encompass Pluto.  It totally
convinced me, so check that out.
